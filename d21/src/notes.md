I think I'll generate all potential command sequences for each key combination
3 -> 7 should have 4 different ways, etc.
same for the arrows

then i'll just derive all combinations and get the shortest one

Fuck this shit

Also, the string concatenation is kind of annoying.
maybe i can have a graph with parents
