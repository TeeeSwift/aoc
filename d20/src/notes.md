Let's make an array of positions that represent the race track
Each position will have a row and column

Then find combinations of positions where there is 1 square between them
of those, see which ones have a gap between them greater than 2, as these
represent shortcuts.

return the count of pairs over 100 i guess


parse_input accepts filename
returns grid

get_path accepts grid
returns a vector of positions
